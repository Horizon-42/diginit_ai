0,,0,,0,,0,0,0,"Die verschiedenen Aufenthaltspapiere (unvollständige Auflistung – Stand August 2017) Für die Einreise und den Aufenthalt in Deutschland ist für Ausländer grundsätzlich ein Aufenthaltstitel erforderlich. Das Aufenthaltsgesetz unterscheidet hierbei fünf unterschiedliche Aufenthaltstitel: Die Aufenthaltserlaubnis ist ein befristeter Aufenthaltstitel mit bestimmten Beschränkungen, der für Zwecke wie u.a. der Ausbildung, der Erwerbstätigkeit oder aus völkerrechtlichen, humanitären oder politischen Gründen erteilt wird. Die Blaue Karte EU ist ein zweckgebundener Aufenthaltstitel für akademische Fachkräfte (§ 19 a AufenthG). Die Erlaubnis zum Daueraufenthalt – EU erhalten Ausländer aus Drittstaaten nach fünfjährigen rechtmäßigen Aufenthalt in einem Mitgliedstaat der EU. Dieser unbefristete Aufenthaltstitel ist in § 9a Aufenthaltsgesetz geregelt. Die Niederlassungserlaubnis ist ein unbefristeter Aufenthaltstitel. Die Voraussetzungen zur Erteilung sind in § 9 AufenthG geregelt. Das Visum ist eine behördliche Genehmigung, die es Ausländern erlaubt, in einem bestimmten Land einzureisen und sich dort für einen bestimmten Zeitraum aufzuhalten. § 6 AufenthG und der Schengener Grenzkodex unterscheiden zwischen unterschiedlichen Arten von Visa. Während der Prüfung eines Erst.- oder Folgeantrags erhalten Asylbewerber und Flüchtlinge eine Aufenthaltsgestattung (§ 55 AsylG). Damit wird bescheinigt, dass derzeit ein Asylverfahren durchgeführt wird. Die Aufenthaltsgestattung stellt keinen Aufenthaltstitel dar, sondern gestattet es dem Asylbewerber nur, für die Dauer seines Verfahrens rechtmäßig in Deutschland zu leben. Die Duldung (§ 60a AufenthG) bescheinigt, dass eine Abschiebung vorerst nicht vollzogen werden kann, weil bestimmte Abschiebehindernisse gegeben sind. Abschiebehindernisse können z.B. sein, das Fehlen eines Passes, eine Erkrankung oder fehlende Transportmöglichkeiten in das Zielland sein. Eine Duldung ist kein Aufenthaltstitel und begründet daher keinen rechtmäßigen Aufenthalt. Der Inhaber bleibt grundsätzlich zur Ausreise verpflichtet. Eine Übersicht der einzelnen Formen der Duldungen hat die GGUA Flüchtlingshilfe zusammengestellt. Anmerkung: Die Informationen haben keinen Anspruch auf Vollständigkeit und dienen der Orientierung und ersetzen keine individuelle Beratung durch Rechtsanwalt oder Migrationsberatungsstelle. Sie bilden zudem die aktuelle Rechtslage ab, die sich in Zukunft ändern kann.",residential_permit_wurzburg,3780
0,,0,,0,,0,0,0,"Grundbegriffe des Asylrechts kurz erläutert Asyl Der Ursprung des Wortes liegt im Griechischen und bedeutet soviel wie „unberaubt“ oder „sicher“. Laut Duden versteht man darunter ein Heim, einen Zufluchtsort, eine Unterkunft für Obdachlose oder die Aufnahme und den Schutz für Verfolgte. Asylberechtigter Als Asylberechtigte gelten Personen, welche nach Art. 16a GG ein Recht auf Anerkennung der Asyleigenschaft haben. Umgangssprachlich werden damit jedoch auch Personen bezeichnet, die ein Recht auf einen anderen im Asylverfahren zu prüfenden Schutzstatus haben. Asylbewerber/Asylsuchende/Schutzsuchende Dies sind Personen, deren Asylverfahren noch nicht abgeschlossen ist. Dabei ist ein Asylsuchender jemand, der ein Asylgesuch geäußert, aber noch keinen Antrag gestellt hat. Ein Asylbewerber ist man dagegen ab Antragstellung. Duldung Die Duldung ist die vorübergehende Aussetzung der Abschiebung eines ausreisepflichtigen Ausländers (§ 60a AufenthG). Flüchtling Als Flüchtling gilt nach der Genfer Flüchtlingskonvention (GFK) eine Person, die aus begründeter Furcht vor Verfolgung wegen ihrer Ethnie, Religion, Nationalität, politischen Überzeugung oder Zugehörigkeit zu einer bestimmten sozialen Gruppe, zu denen auch das Geschlecht oder die sexuelle Identität gezählt werden, sich außerhalb des Landes befindet, dessen Staatsangehörigkeit sie besitzt und dessen Schutz sie nicht in Anspruch nehmen kann oder wegen Furcht nicht in Anspruch nehmen will (s. Art. 1 GFK und §§ 3 bis 3e AsylVfG). Flüchtlingsschutz Eine Person darf nicht in einen Staat abgeschoben werden, in dem sein Leben oder seine Freiheit wegen seiner Ethnie, Religion, Nationalität, seiner Zugehörigkeit zu einer bestimmten sozialen Gruppe oder wegen seiner politischen Überzeugung bedroht ist (§ 60 Abs. 1 AufenthG). Kontingentflüchtlinge Kontingentflüchtlinge sind Flüchtlinge aus Krisenregionen, die im Rahmen von humanitären Hilfsaktionen in Deutschland aufgenommen werden, ohne vorher in Deutschland einen Antrag auf Asyl gestellt haben zu müssen. Subsidiärer Schutz Eine Person ist subsidiär schutzberechtigt, wenn sie stichhaltige Gründe für die Annahme vorgebracht hat, dass ihr in ihrem Herkunftsland ein ernsthafter Schaden droht (§ 60 Abs 2. AufenthG, § 4 AsylVfG). Sprache als Mittel der Ausgrenzung Sprache ist mächtig. Sie ordnet soziale Beziehungen und legt fest, wer dazu gehört und wer ausgegrenzt oder sogar rassistisch diskriminiert wird. Deswegen ist es, wichtig auf Wörter wie „Asylant“ oder „Wirtschaftsflüchtling“ zu verzichten, weil darin die Unterstellung transportiert wird, dass Flüchtlinge per se „Scheinasylanten“ sind oder sie es ausschließlich auf Sozialleistungen abgesehen haben.",wuerzburg_basic_concepts,3781
